## ⚖️ MergeJudge

**Overall lane:** 🟡 `review` · 6 of 6 files need a human look · 3 problems found · 5 line comments

*`review` is advisory: the `mergejudge/lane` check stays neutral; only `block` fails it.*

Adds a CI workflow, a Shepherd workflow pinned to a runner commit, a small dependency-free lint script with --fix, a test file and package.json, and lowers shepherd.max\_attempts to 1. The Shepherd workflow uses an App installation token with write permissions and a third-party action pinned by SHA.

### What to check

**scripts/lint.mjs**
- **Logic (high):** The lint script reports success and exits 0 in --fix mode even when problems remain, and crashes if src/ is absent. [L19](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-a28c115d54cc0fb754b50eb6843def6e1642ea0d5c998e9934a11807ff121ac8R19) · line comment
- **Error handling (medium):** readdirSync on src is unguarded and file writes/reads have no error handling. [L7](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-a28c115d54cc0fb754b50eb6843def6e1642ea0d5c998e9934a11807ff121ac8R7) · line comment

**test/math.test.js**
- **Tests (low, 2/5):** A math test is added but the new lint script and workflow behaviour are untested; the test also imports src/math.js which is not in this PR. [L3](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-e2c68e7e194e330dc2e863bfcf48a429b7baa049c4ee41da7ffe8034faf42dbdR3)

**.github/workflows/shepherd.yml**
- [L26](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-d3230df32ebe571bd9b3ea9b7d89d00a0f3f9def5f752c8f57fc50d0f4981578R26) actions: write allows re-running/cancelling workflows; confirm this is needed and scoped as intended.
- [L37](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-d3230df32ebe571bd9b3ea9b7d89d00a0f3f9def5f752c8f57fc50d0f4981578R37) issue\_comment path does not check commenter permission here; ensure the runner gates on write access before acting.
- [L55](https://github.com/gauravsharmaGG/mergejudge-free-test/pull/7/files#diff-d3230df32ebe571bd9b3ea9b7d89d00a0f3f9def5f752c8f57fc50d0f4981578R55) Third-party action receives App private key and write tokens; verify the pinned SHA corresponds to the reviewed runner code.

- **Code file:** `scripts/lint.mjs`, `test/math.test.js`

AI notes:

- `.github/workflows/shepherd.yml`: Third-party action with contents/pull-requests/issues/actions write, secrets passed in; SHA pin looks full but should be human-verified.
- `scripts/lint.mjs`: Local file-rewriting script; readdirSync on src will throw if src is missing, and --fix always reports success.
